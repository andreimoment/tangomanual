## Description

Super useful cute tiny back tuck or mini-"volcada"

### Steps

1. Help them do the follower's tuck solo a few times
2. Distingush tuck from a pivot-ocho, and have them do both
3. Go into crossed system and take first step on left side (open side) 
4. Lead back extension
5. Lead tuck ("plop!")
6. Lead untuck
7. Walk out in crossed system to the cross

### Tips

* Helps if lead sets up with small ocho, keep weight on both legs, lead extension from belly
* To get tuck, use embrace to move her ribcage toward your armpit 
* It is like starting to fall for the follower. Extended leg catches balance on other side of foot
* Leader needs to be ready to receive some of follower's weight! 
* To lead untuck: leader brings belly button toward spine

### Bonus!

* Try it on the other side!
* Find it from parallel system. Hint - the leader gets to cross!
* Try to double up - lead two tucks in a row (fall right, fall left)
