## Description

In this game you'll switch roles with increasing frequency. Use a practice hold. When you change roles, change which person's arms are underneath. 

By the way: It counts as a step even if only one person steps or changes weight. Also - it is helpful to slow down and pause before a role change. 

1. Switch roles anytime either person feels it is a "musically significant moment." Count how many times you switched in a song and compare notes afterwards. 
2. Switch roles every 5 steps for a song
3. Switch roles every 3 steps for a song
4. Switch roles every step!
