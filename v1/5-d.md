## Description

An enjoyable compact turn for a small crowded dance floor

### Steps

1. Lead crossed salida practice hold. 
2. Lead it making it curl to the left. So cross ends up behind you
3. Do with on-the-body contact with continuous tone, no arms
4. Add embrace and repeat til it's pretty consistent

### Tips

* The milonguero turn is just the follower curling the walk to the cross 
* Remember! Leader's footwork doesn't matter much, stay focused on follower's pattern
* When they lead, see what footwork they do naturally and help troubleshoot if legs in way
* Leader needs to do the same ribcage isolation as ocho cortado to get the cross
