## Description

Comfortable unusual walk on closed side of the embrace

### Steps

1. In practice hold, make a shared side step handward
2. Secret weight change for leader
3. Advance with free (left) leg on hugward ("dark") side 
4. Take one more step on dark side (leader's right leg), receiving backward ocho
5. Take next step on light side, receiving second backward ocho and continue to the cross
6. Do with on-the-body contact with continuous tone, no arms
7. Add embrace

### Tips

* Helps if leader lands in side step with hips angled inward direction  toward dark side
* Do it slowly in practice hold a lot of times. This move holds danger for follower's toes if rushed into close embrace

### Bonus!

* Explore why walking on dark side doesn't auto-cross (hint: embrace and line of dance!)
* Find a few different entrances into dark side walking
* Find a few more exits from dark side walking
