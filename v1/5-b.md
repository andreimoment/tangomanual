## Description

The best way to the cross in close embrace

### Steps

1. Do crossed salida (from "The Other System" mission) slowly in practice hold. 
2. Do secret weight change on double-time
3. Once that's working, lead follower's cross on double-time
4. Now lead with on-the-body contact (no arms) with continuous tone
5. Add arms/embrace
6. Switch roles

### Tips

* When first doing it on-the-body, calibrate to 7-8
* Helps if leader makes two BIG CLEAR BRAVE steps Left, Right to the cross, "VaVoom!" It can help to think of making the two steps into a single large gestute. 
* There is a tendency for the leader to swallow the 2nd step on the way to the cross. This might happen because they aren't sure where the follower's feet are. If they hesitate, help them pause and try to perceive the follower's body through back arm and points of contact. 
* Have leader say "cross" and pause when they feel the follower cross. 

### Bonus!

* Graft it onto the end of Rock-Step-Open, using side step of Rock-Step-Open as 1st step of Crossed Salida
* Explain why it's preferred way of going to cross in close embrace (easier to stay close)
