## Description

The first full turn is surprisingly easy

### Steps

1. Show "americano" where both do big forward ocho
2. Show how turning landing feet out in open step can help it really flow easily to americano ("fauxcho")
3. Help them walk through follower's part: full turn starts & ends with forward
4. Show how leader sacadas with right leg
5. Show how leader pivot-crosses inward to invite follow's back step…
6. ...And keeps pivoting on new foot til walk out in americano with right

### Tips

* Remind follower to stay close to leader. (Side step tends to fall out of orbit)
* Remind leader to keep opening/inviting with left side of embrace.

### Bonus!

* Find a variation with different leader's footwork
