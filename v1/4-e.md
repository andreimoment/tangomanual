## Description

The deceptively simple challenge of walking together

### Steps

1. In practice embrace, follower extends backwards, returns. Leader shadows, matches.  
2. Now leader invites extension without moving his feet. Hint: solar plexus!
3. Repeat 1-2 in a close embace. 
4. Now lead 2 steps inline, then side step. Repeat - this cycles the starting foot. Do this for about half a song. 
5. Try 4 steps inline.

### Tips

* For this one it can help to switch roles really often
* Good moment to review Extension - stretching leg w/o placing weight

### Bonus!

* Ready for a challenge? Lead/follow a circle with free legs before 1st step! Downstream, out, upstream, GO!
