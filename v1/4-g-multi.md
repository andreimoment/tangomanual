## Description

Coming and going together is harder than it looks

### Steps

1. Inline advancing, weight change, inline retreating, weight change
2. Once it's working, do it in a close embrace (no arms)
3. Then add arms

### Tips

* Easiest to start with leader's left, follower's right (handwards side)

### Bonus!

Tons of variations on this one!

* Try the other side: starting on hugward side
* Change the size: advancing bigger, retreating smaller
* Play with rhythm - hardest but soo good! Mmm syncopation!
* Instead of advance/retreat, try 2x advance
* Try 2x retreat - deal with navigation puzzle! 
* Make one of the steps outside-partner instead of inline
