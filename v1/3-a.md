## Description

Easy pattern with lots of variants to quickstart milonga

### Steps

1. Lead the box step, a six-count square pattern that starts w/leader retreating inline with right leg.
2. Occasionally add 1 or 2 extra steps hugward at the end (top) of the box. This ensures weight shifts are being accurately communicated. 
4. Make the box step rotate clockwise
5. Switch roles.

### Tips

* When they lead, be sure you can feel them leading the weight shifts
* Point out that the whole box step is in parallel system

### Bonus!

* Define basic terms: tanda, tango, milonga (the party), milonga (the music)
