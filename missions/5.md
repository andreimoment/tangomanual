## Checklist

* Frontality
* Vs Six Count: Default/Interrupt
* Committing the X
* Leader's extra shift

## More Detail

The 8-count salida with the follower's cross.

### Steps

1. Demonstrate the Cross solo
2. Have them copy you
3. Lead them to the cross and resolution
4. Alternate between the Cross and the First Figure. 
5. Have them lead it
6. Have them alternate between the two figures. 

### Tips

* Be sure they really transfer weight when they cross: explain free leg/standing leg
* Both partners hips should face each other at the cross
* Have the leader study the follower's crossed legs, to see which leg to step with after the cross. 

### Bonus! 

* Explain the cross is a default for the follower. The follower does it unless the leader interrupts.
