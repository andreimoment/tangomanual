## Infintite Fractal Detail

One person makes movements. The other copies them. 

1. Start with big, slow upper body movements. 
2. Work to more subtle movements. 
3. Switch lead. 
4. Switch lead without speaking. 

This exercise practices and introduces deep connection in leading/following. 

Tips: 

* Find a place where there isn’t dance traffic. 
* Ask the host to play lyrical music
