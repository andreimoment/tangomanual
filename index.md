# Welcome to the Operating Manual for Tango!

**[Go to the Tango Learning Missions &rarr;](v1/index.md)**

## Open-source Tango Curriculum

This open-source, collaboratively edited curriculum is designed to provide structure for the first 30-60 hours of beginner level tango learning.

The intent is to support tango community organizers in smaller communities, and tango university clubs, by providing an easy-to-use learning missions including videos that intermediate and advanced dancers can use to integrate newcomers to tango. 

It is our hope that this becomes a part of an ecosystem of tools that support the growth of community through social, improvised tango.

### Active, community-driven project

The Tango Manual is under active development which means frequent additions and improvements. You are our community and we invite you to take part in both. To suggest an improvement, consult the [instructions](https://github.com/andreimoment/tangomanual#how-to-contribute) or go directly to the [project issues](https://github.com/andreimoment/tangomanual/issues).

## Basic language
* RING - A tango level. Each ring is a different color and has a different theme. 
* MISSION - A mission is a unit of nano-learning with a specific learning outcome. Missions that teach new movement material have this [anatomy](http://tangomanual.com/v1/appendix/anatomy-of-a-mission)
* BUDDY - A tango learner who is qualified and prepared to teach this mission
* ZONE - A zone is a set of technique drills, exercises or practice games that you are never really "done" with.

Here is a [glossary of terms](http://tangomanual.com/v1/appendix/glossary-of-terms) we are using in this manual.

## Our values

We seek to model and expand values that support connection, including: 

* Honoring intergenerational learning
* Celebrating improvisation and the experience of social tango for its own sake
* Supporting the teachers who have made all that we cherish possible by buying their instructional offerings
* Supporting living, in-person community and the organizers who facilitate these experiences
* Supporting tango music and the musicians who create it by buying music
* Celebrating the contributions of all those we've learn from, telling their stories
* Working to create an ever-more safe, comfortable and equitable experience for everyone
* Grounding our communication nonviolently in [feelings](https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/feelings_inventory_0.pdf) and [needs](https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/needs_inventory_0.pdf), instead of judgements and demands
* Remembering appreciation and expanding lovingkindness to self and to all
* Spreading the message of our essential interdependence in tango and tango learning
