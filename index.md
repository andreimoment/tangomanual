# Welcome to the Operating Manual for Tango!

**[Go to the Tango Learning Missions &rarr;](v1/index.md)**

## Open-source Tango Curriculum

This free, open-source, collaboratively-edited curriculum provides structure for the first 30-60 hours of beginner-level tango learning. It consists of easy-to-use learning missions with teaching instructions and videos that intermediate and advanced dancers can use to integrate newcomers to tango.

### Peer-to-peer learning

The missions are designed for peer-to-peer learning and involve one-on-one sessions for each lesson, for each student. These one-on-one sessions bring together teaching tailored to the particular student's level and abilities, and deep learning-while-teaching for the more advanced dancer (buddy) presenting the material. 

In our experience, the peer-to-peer learning process results in the emergence of strong, well-connected communities. We are very excited to see it applied on a large scale.

### For tango community organizers and university tango clubs

We know that tango community organizers in smaller communities and in university tango clubs need to to regularly bring new curriculum. We believe that a systematic, well-tested, evolving curriculum can be especially useful to such organizers as well as any organization intending to bring tango to its members. 

### Active, community-driven project

The Tango Manual is part of a growing ecosystem of tango learning resources being developed collaboratively by Tango dancers and coordinated by the Tango Hatchery. is a beta test which means it is still evolving. We invite you to participate via the [Tango Hatchery forum](https://www.tangohatchery.com/forum). 

## Basic language
* RING - A tango level. Each ring is a different color and has a different theme. 
* MISSION - A mission is a unit of nano-learning with a specific learning outcome. Missions that teach new movement material have this [anatomy](http://tangomanual.com/v1/appendix/ap-e-anatomy-of-a-mission)
* BUDDY - A tango learner who is qualified and prepared to teach this mission
* ZONE - A zone is a set of technique drills, exercises or practice games that you are never really "done" with.

Here is a [glossary of terms](http://tangomanual.com/v1/appendix/ap-c-glossary-of-terms) we are using in this manual.

## Our values

We seek to model and expand values that support connection, including: 

* Honoring intergenerational learning
* Celebrating improvisation and the experience of social tango for its own sake
* Supporting the teachers who have made all that we cherish possible by buying their instructional offerings
* Supporting living, in-person community and the organizers who facilitate these experiences
* Supporting tango music and the musicians who create it by buying music
* Celebrating the contributions of all those we've learn from, telling their stories
* Working to create an ever-more safe, comfortable and equitable experience for everyone
* Grounding our communication nonviolently in [feelings](https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/feelings_inventory_0.pdf) and [needs](https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/needs_inventory_0.pdf), instead of judgements and demands
* Remembering appreciation and expanding lovingkindness to self and to all
* Spreading the message of our essential interdependence in tango and tango learning
