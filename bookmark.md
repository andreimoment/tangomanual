## How to Bookmark the Tango Manual (and add it to your device home screen!)

### On iOS

1. **Open the Tango Manual Mission List page in Safari**
2. **Tap the options icon** That's the square with an arrow pointing up icon in the icon bar at the bottom of the screen. You may have to scroll the page up/downn for the bar to appear.
3. **Tap the icon which says "Add to Home Screen"**
4. :sunglasses: You rock!

### On Android

1. **Open the Tango Manual Mission List page in Chrome**
2. **Open Chrome's menu**
3. **Tap the "Add to Home Screen" option**
4. :sunglasses: ... Now Tango!
