# Operating Manual For Tango

## An Open Source Approach to Teaching Tango

## How to Contribute

### Found a typo or mistake? Have idea for a new mission?

#### Create a github issue.

GitHub issues is where people working on a project talk about specific project related issues and tasks. Here's [how to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) (if you don't have a github account you'll be prompted to create one). 

Make sure you mention the mission number and be as specific as you can. A good issue title would be "4-F: The steps in the description do not match the video." Make the description as specific as possible.

Here's a link to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/andreimoment/tangomanual/issues) for this project.

### Want to suggest a mission rewrite? Or create a brand new mission? 

#### Fork the manual, rewrite the mission and create a pull request.

Whoa, Neo, not everyone is a hacker. What is this forking and pulling stuff?

Glad you asked. 

A fork is a copy of a repository. It knows where it was copied from and can tell the difference between its contents and the contents of the original. When you create your own fork/copy, you can change it, and you can send a special message to the owner of the original pointing out the changes you made and asking the owner to include them. That's the pull request.

Here are some GitHub's help pages: [About Forks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/), [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
