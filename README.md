# Operating Manual For Tango

## An Open Source Approach to Teaching Tango

## How to Contribute

### Found a typo or mistake? Have idea for a new mission?

#### Create a github issue

Issues (see the *Issues* tab in the menu above) is a forum-like part of a github project where people converse about project-related issues and tasks. To create an issue, you'll need to have a GitHub account. 

When creating a mission-specific issue, please:

* Make sure this issue doesn't yet exist. If it does, add a comment to that conversation instead.
* Mention the mission code in the issue title
* Be as specific as possible in the description

##### Example of a well-structured issue

* **Title:** 4-F: The steps in the description do not match the video. (contains the mission number and a one-line description)
* **Description:** 3. Leader turns to the right does not correspond to the video which shows the leader turning to the left. (a very specific description)

### Want to suggest a mission rewrite? Or create a brand new mission? 

#### Fork the *tangomanual* repository, rewrite the mission and create a pull request

*Whoa, Neo, not everyone is a hacker. What is this forking and pulling stuff?*

A "fork" is a special copy of a repository. It knows where it was copied from and when, and can tell the difference between its own content and the content of the original. 

When you fork a repository, you end up with your own copy over which you have full control. This is where you make the changes you want to see in the original. Once you are done, you send a special message to the owner of the original pointing out the changes you made, and request the owner to include, or "pull" them in the original. That's the "pull request."

Here are the steps:

1. Create your own fork (button in top right of the project)
2. Make changes
3. Click on the "Pull requests" grey tab of the forked project
4. Create a pull request, remember to describe the changes

Please:

* Create individual pull requests for each mission -- makes discussion easy.
* Make sure to have your version synced with the original if some time passes between your forking the project and the pull request being ready.
* You may want to create changes in a branch. 

Here is GitHub's guide on [forks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/), and one on [creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

*When I edit a mission, I see pound signs and stars and underscores and square brackets in the text... what are these?* 

These are a part of the GitHub [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which allows you to create titles, italics, bold and links in plain text documents, without having to learn and write HTML code. By the way, you can also add [emoji](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)!
