# Operating Manual For Tango

## An Open Source Approach to Teaching Tango

## How to Contribute

### Found a typo or mistake? Have idea for a new mission?

#### Create a github issue

GitHub issues is a forum-like part of github where people converse about project-related issues and tasks. Here's [how to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) (if you don't have a github account you'll be prompted to create one). 

Make sure you mention the mission number and be very specific. A good issue title would be "4-F: The steps in the description do not match the video." 

The description might say something like: "3. Leader turns to the right does not correspond to the video which shows the leader turning to the left."

Here's a link to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/andreimoment/tangomanual/issues) for this project.

### Want to suggest a mission rewrite? Or create a brand new mission? 

#### Fork the manual, rewrite the mission and create a pull request

*Whoa, Neo, not everyone is a hacker. What is this forking and pulling stuff?*

A *fork* is a special copy of a code repository. It knows where it was copied from and when, and can tell the difference between its contents and the contents of the original. When you fork a repository, you end up with your own copy where you have full control and can make changes. This is where you make the changes you want to see in the original. Once you are done, you send a special message to the owner of the original pointing out the changes you made, and request the owner to include/*pull* them in the original. That's the *pull request*.

Here are some GitHub's help pages: [About Forks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/), [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
